# Extrovert vs Introvert Personality Classifier

This project presents a clean machine learning pipeline to classify individuals as **Introverts** or **Extroverts** based on behavioral traits. The entire workflow is implemented in a single Jupyter notebook: `Data_Processing_Workflow.ipynb`.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rakeshkapilavai/extrovert-vs-introvert-behavior-data)
- **Size:** ~2,900 rows Ã— 8 columns
- **Target Column:** `Personality` (Extrovert / Introvert)

## ðŸ§  Workflow Overview

The notebook includes:

- **Data Cleaning**
  - Handles missing values (drops or imputes based on threshold)
  - Encodes categorical values (`Yes`/`No` â†’ Boolean)
  - Strips whitespace and removes duplicate entries
  - Encodes `Personality`: Introvert â†’ 1, Extrovert â†’ 0

- **Data Preparation**
  - Splits data into training and test sets

- **Model Training**
  - Uses Logistic Regression with class balancing
  - Evaluates with accuracy and classification report

- **Model Saving**
  - Trained model saved using `joblib` for future use
